# snowflake-end-to-end-project
This repository documents my hands-on learning and implementation of an end-to-end data pipeline using **Snowflake** and **AWS S3**. The project covers structured and semi-structured data handling, storage integration, automation, security, and advanced Snowflake features like Time travel, Zero copy cloning, and dynamic data masking.
